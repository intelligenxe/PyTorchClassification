If you do NOT have a GPU you have to replace 'cuda' by 'cpu'  in the torchnn.py code   <br>
<br>
Commands to run the code in a virtual environment: <br>


git clone https://github.com/intelligenxe/PyTorchClassification.git <br>
pip install torch  <br>
pip install torchvision     # this one contains the pillow (PIL) pillow library   <br>
python3 torchnn.py  <br>
